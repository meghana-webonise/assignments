git init

Initializes a git repository – creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or in an existing project. Example: cd /home/user/my_new_git_folder/ git init

git clone

Makes a Git repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions.

git add

Adds files changes in your working directory to your index.

git commit

Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit.
